![Image](/Images/Home_View.png)

 Drawers for the horizontal body panels.  I designed this for the COM-8 CSR frame.  It can be mounted to the frame, or to the skins.  

 I have included the STL's and the Fusion 360 file that you can open and edit anything you'd like.  

 Hardware Needed:
 1. [Servos](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07RRWYXL9?psc=1&ref=ppx_yo2ov_dt_b_product_details) x4: ES08MA II  (HITEC HS65 will also work)
 2. (4) #0-80 5/8" Screws
 3. (8-24) #0-80 nuts
