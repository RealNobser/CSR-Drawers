![Image](/Images/Home_View.png)

 Drawers for the horizontal body panels.  I designed this for the COM-8 CSR frame.  It can be mounted to the frame, or to the skins.  

 I have included the STL's and the Fusion 360 file that you can open and edit anything you'd like.  

 Hardware Needed:
 1. (4) [ES08MA II Servos](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07RRWYXL9?psc=1&ref=ppx_yo2ov_dt_b_product_details)  (HITEC HS65 will also work)
 2. (4) #0-80 5/8" Screws
 3. (8-24) #0-80 nuts
 4. (3) M3x10mm screws
 5. (3) M3x5 scews
 6. (6-11) M3 pressed/heated inserts
 7. (88) 10x5x2mm neodynium N48 Magnets (24 each drawer)
 8. (7) #4-40 1/2" tapered flat head screw (optional for skirt mount)
 9. (7) #4-40 Lock nuts (optional for skirt mount)
 

 1/16" drill bit on third/middle hole of the long servo horn that has one side cut off.  



Thamks to Doc Snyder and Matt Hobbs for the inspiration for these drawers.
