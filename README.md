# Horizontal Drawers for the COM-8 CSR Frame

![Image](/Images/Home_View.png)

 Drawers for the horizontal body panels.  I designed this for the COM-8 CSR frame.  It can be mounted to the frame, or to the skins.  

 I have included the STL's and the Fusion 360 file that you can open and edit anything you'd like.  

 Hardware Needed:
 1. ES08MA II Servos: Qty:4 [Link](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07RRWYXL9?psc=1&ref=ppx_yo2ov_dt_b_product_details)  (HITEC HS65 will also work)
 2. #0-80 5/8" Screws Qty: 4
 3. #0-80 nuts Qty: 8
 4. M3x10mm screws Qty: 6
 5. M3 pressed/heated inserts Qty: 6  (I also use thse to mount to my frame so I used 11 in total)
 6  10x5x2mm neodynium N48 Magnets Qty: 88 [Link](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0B6PBXBVJ?psc=1&ref=ppx_yo2ov_dt_b_product_details)
 7. M3x10 tapered screws Qty: 5 (Only used if you are using the pressed inserts to mount the drawers to the frame)
 7. (7) #4-40 1/2" tapered flat head screw (optional for skirt mount)
 8. (7) #4-40 Lock nuts (optional for skirt mount)
 

I cut the longest servo arm that came with the servos.  This is the doublesided one.  I cut one side of it off.  I then drilled out the middle hole with a 1/16" drill bit to allow the bolt to go through.  

I sanded the sides of each of the holders to make sure they sit flush with each other.  Any variations can cause the alignement to be off.  

I sanded the bottom of the drawrers and the holders to make sure the drawers slide smoothly.  With 3D printing, the top layer is rarely very smooth and likely has some variations.

I sanded the bottom of the drawer guides on the holders that stick out to prevent the drawers from lifting up.

THere are holes in the drawers behind the magnets for 2 purposes.  1 is to allow you to get the magnets out if you need to by poking it out from the back, and the 2nd is to allow a place for the glue to go when gluing in the magnets.  


Thamks to Doc Snyder and Matt Hobbs for the inspiration for these drawers.
